# lambda-starter
lambda starter repo using serverless

You will need to create a `serverless.env.yml` file based on the `serverless.env.example.yml`

- `npm install`

- `npm run start` to start local server, you can hit this server using postman. Ex: `localhost:3000?word=apple`

- `npm run exampleFunction` runs that one function using the mock json file

- `npm run deploy` to deploy your functions to aws and create the endpoints in api-gateway
